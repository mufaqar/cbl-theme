                How Much Speed Do I Need For My Home?
            </h2>
            <p class="PClass">
                How much internet speed is needed for my household? You may ask
                this question to yourself whenever shopping for an Internet
                service provider but there is no simple or direct answer. It
                depends on several different factors such as number of connected
                devices to the internet, how they are being used, someone using it
                for online gaming, video conferencing, streaming on Netflix or
                even working from home. Some households may need more speed than
                the rest because of their use cases. That’s why Cable Movers has
                designed a chart to help you choose the right internet speed for
                your home for seamless online experience.

            <p class="PClass"> While Dish is present in <?php echo $city ?>, we recommend DIRECTV for you entertainment
                needs. DIRECTV offer a broad catalog of channels perfect for watching the latest local sports with
                neighbors or recording your favorite shows while you’re out grocery shopping.</p>

            <p class="PClass"> With DISH, you can choose from multiple tiers of cable TV service packages. This ranges
                from $84.99 for 190 total channels and up to $144.99 per month for over 290 channels. The biggest
                differences are the networks you choose, like ESPN and Disney at the lower end and STARZ and Bloomberg
                at the higher price. In addition, DISH offers easy-to-use accessories like a free DVR for recording all
                the shows you want using a voice-activated remote. Anyone with kids or those who dislike typing in long
                show names will appreciate the voice option. All these services can be bundled, and there are free
                offers for certain premium channels like Showtime and introductory prices upon request.</p>

            <p class="PClass">DirecTV offers HD-quality picture you want for stunning visuals and immersive audio.
                However, the pricing is a little different than dish. The regular introductory level of 165+ channels
                (including the Sports Package free for 3 months) runs $69.99 per month. You can find deals that knock
                off $10-$20 monthly for the first few months, but you must sign a two-year contract for this satellite
                cable service. Another aspect of DirecTV that is different is the available tiers. You can select four
                different packages that vary based on sports, premium networks, and top-tier providers like Max,
                Paramount+, and Showtime. There is a bit more price flexibility in your monthly home expenses. In
                addition, DirecTV has the most comprehensive regional sports networks for local channels and unlimited
                hours for cloud DVR storage, making it a must-have if you never want to miss a college or league game.
